A Natural Language Processing model trained with over 10000  names is used to predict a gender of a person based on the first name of the person.This model is created using Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) a variant of Recurrent Nueral Network which has training accuracy of 99.35%.


# Observation:
- Here we have made a model that the predict the gender by using their name
 
- In Modeling I have used MultinomialNB and LSTM model
 
- The LSTM model performed well for this problem statement. So i selected LSTM to make prediction and I achieved 90% accuracy.which is better for this use case
